# RazorPageMovie-ASP.NETCore
The preceding code looks a lot like a Razor view file used in an ASP.NET Core app with controllers and views. What makes it different is the @page directive. @page makes the file into an MVC action, which means that it handles requests directly, without going through a controller. @page must be the first Razor directive on a page.
